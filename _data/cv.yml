        - title: "Thesis: Customer experience enhancement by Face and Emotion recognition."
          contents:
            - Facial Recognition and Emotion Recognition have received a great deal of attention among communities due to its potential applications in society, such as  automobile security, access control, education, and healthcare. In the scope of my thesis, I focus on improving customers’ experience based on these two techniques. The idea stems from the inconvenience of verifying my individual identity through using an application on my phone whenever visiting coffee shops. As a way to alleviate this problem, with the availability of CCTV cameras in coffee shops, I proposed a real-time application that can automatically determine customers’ identity by face recognition and measure customers’ feedback by emotion recognition. I utilized MTCNN for both face detection and face alignment, FaceNet for disentangled features extracting and AlexNet-inspired CNNs for emotion recognition.
