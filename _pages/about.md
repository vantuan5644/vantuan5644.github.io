My name is Van-Tuan Tran, a Vietnamese individual who has undergone a stochastic journey towards pursuing a career in Data Science and Machine Learning. At present, I am a Research Assistant at VinUniversity, where my focus is centered on rendering deep-black-box models more transparent and trustworthy.

I am actively seeking a PhD position in the area of Self-supervised Learning, Federated Learning, and Trustworthy AI. In addition, I remain open to exploring other research positions relating to Uncertainty Estimation and Deep Learning for Computer Vision.
