Last week, I talk on Generative Models under Business Perspective at the [TECH Meetup - AI and Data Science edition!](https://www.meetup.com/tech-meetup/events/290061095/). The slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mGl4wzO-P0Io9QTXpTA_73V99x2oXj09_XoswfrKzBo).

#### Abstract
Recently, generative models have become increasingly popular and are often touted as the "next big thing" in AI and machine learning. However, the hype around these models can be misleading and may obscure their true capabilities and limitations.

This presentation aims to demystify generative models and provide a clear understanding of what they are, how they work, and what they can do. Using non-technical language, we will explore the recent types of generative models, including the all-the-rage ChatGPT and DALL-E 2.

I will also discuss the current state of the art in generative models and the various applications they have been used for, such as image and text generation, music creation, and even video game design.

In addition, the presentation will provide personal predictions for where generative models are headed in the future and how they will impact various industries, including creative arts, advertising, and healthcare. I will also discuss how to prepare for the future of generative models, including ethical considerations and potential risks.

By the end of the presentation, attendees will have a clear understanding of what generative models are, how they work, and what their potential applications are. They will also have a better understanding of the current hype around generative models and how to prepare for the future of AI and machine learning.
